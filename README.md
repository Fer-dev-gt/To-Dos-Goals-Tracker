<h1 align="center" id="title">To-Do's Goals</h1>
To-Do's Goals Tracker is a website designed to help you managing your pending tasks and goals you want to achieve by simply creating a list of items of the To Do's you want to complete on the near future. There's no limit to the amount of To Do's you can create (but is better to not have so many pending tasks üòâ). Once you've finished an existing task you can mark it as completed and the selected To Do will go to the bottom of your list, you can also delete it from your list by simply pressing the trashcan button.

Don't be shy and try it yourself, there are many surprises waiting for you! https://fer-dev-gt.github.io/To-Dos-Goals-Tracker/

# React Documentation ‚¨áÔ∏è
## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
